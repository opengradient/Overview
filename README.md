### Open Gradient is a conduct risk consulting company that helps financial services firms mitigate and monitor conduct risk.

Conduct risk events occur when the actions of an employee, or group of employees, result in financial harm to a firm, its clients, or any of the firm's stakeholders. Conduct risk events or breaches typically result in reputation damage, regulatory fines, and legal action.

Open Gradient derives its name from the open source code community and stochastic gradient decent which was one of the seminal techniques used by data scientists to help machine learning algorithms learn from their mistakes.

#### Conduct risk mitigation
To mitigate conduct risk effectively a firm must first understand its corporate culture. The research focus of Open Gradient around corporate culture crosses over several behavioural science disciplines.

The goal of this research is to help financial services firms understand their cultural type and how it affects the likelihood of a breach in the future. Some cultural types are viewed as more prone than others to a conduct risk breach.

Awareness of the aggregate cultural type or types within a firm is as relevant to mitigating conduct risk as it is to maximising shareholder value and ensuring relevancy to a company's current and future client base.

#### Conduct risk monitoring
Data to monitor conduct risk can come in many forms and from many sources. The tools to gather and analyse that data are evolving at a significant pace and are also being made publicly available to data scientists via the open source community.

While much of the research focus around corporate culture involves traditional statistics and behavioural science, the research focus around conduct risk monitoring is centred in data science and machine learning. ML_Supervisor is a product 
of this research push.
 
ML_Supervisor is a conduct risk monitoring tool that uses natural language processing algorithms to help risk staff search for and extract target content of interest from electronic communications.
